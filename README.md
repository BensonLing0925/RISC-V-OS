# RISC-V-OS
A minimalist RISC-V operating system kernel written in C, focusing on S-mode trap handling, context switching, and memory management. This project explores fundamental OS concepts such as privilege levels, page table management, and custom trap frames, implemented from scratch with QEMU and the RISC-V GNU toolchain.
